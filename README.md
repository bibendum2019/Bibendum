Application Description - 
Our application is a mobile app designed to keep track of habits. Part of self-care is tracking the different aspects of wellness and habits are a way of gauging that. By improving our habits, whether it be adopting positive ones or getting rid of negative ones, we get closer to the goal of wellbeing. 
- The tags for habits at the beginning correspond to the aspects of wellness, this will help show how holistic of an approach the person would 
- It's a mobile application because it makes it's something you have with you everyday and so it's easier to input data
- Students are the target audience and so the habit app was gamified in order to be more appealing and rewarding

Game Details:
The game aspect is simply a text based survival game. Everytime you complete the habits you set out for yourself that day, you are rewarded with the ability to rescue more people and add them to your Stronghold. After reaching milestones in your habits, you gain Items that help improve the Stronghold and let you rescue more people.
- Rescue points are the short-term reward for completing the habit for the day
- Stronghold points are based on items and show accumulation of long term rewards
- The milestones are spaced out from short-term goals to longer term goals, from one week, two weeks, one month, and every month after until the completion of the habit
    - Items are given as a reward
- Items show details like which habit you got it from, the start date and the milestone duration of the habit and the frequency
Metaphor for building habits and becoming the best version of oneself
